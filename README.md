# Diabetes-Prediction
# Predictive Analysis of Diabetes using Machine Learning
My first main project. This project deals with Prediction of Diabetes using Machine Learning Algorithms.

This project involves building a machine learning model in Python to predict diabetes risk based on patient health data, such as age, BMI, blood pressure, 
and glucose levels. Using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn, the project follows an end-to-end pipeline: data preprocessing, feature 
engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation. Multiple algorithms are tested to identify the model with the highest predictive accuracy.
